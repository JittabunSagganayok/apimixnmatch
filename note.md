Docker Compose

docker-compose up creates and runs a collection of containers
docker-compose stop stops the containers
docker-compose start starts the containers
docker-compose down stops and removes the containers
(this is the answer for the question)

docker-compose up -d
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start

node index.js
